## üèÉ Getting Started

> [!WARNING]
> Kavinƒó is still in a very early stage of development and may change at any time.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone or fork the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/robke96/kavine.git
cd kavine
```
### 2. Install Bun and Dependencies
- If you haven't installed [Bun](https://bun.sh/), install it first:
- Then install project dependencies:
```shell
      bun install
``` 

### 3. Create a Discord Server

### 4. Setup Docker (Recommended)
For a quick, isolated development setup, use Docker:

```shell
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d
```
This command will start all necessary services in the background.

#### Without Docker (Manual Setup)
If you prefer not to use Docker, you can manually set up the necessary services like MongoDB and MinIO - or any S3-compatible service.


### 5. Configure .env
1. Fill credentials
   - BOT_TOKEN: Create your bot and retrieve the token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - MONGO_URI: If using Docker, you can keep the default value.
   - GUILD_ID: Insert your Discord server (guild) ID.
   - S3 Configuration (Docker): 
      - Open `localhost:9001` in your browser
      - Use the login details from `compose.dev.yml`
      - Create a bucket with the name specified in `S3_BUCKETNAME`
      - Set the bucket's access policy to **public** and generate Access Keys.
   - SYSTEM: Leave blank to default to `true` or set to `FALSE` to disable the system.

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`

### 6. Run the Bot
Once everything is set up, start the bot using
```shell
bun run start
```
